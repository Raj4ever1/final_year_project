                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPrecision agriculture is being followed in few countries; the
                agriculture enterprise in India nonetheless ought to technologies with the use of technology for higher
                manufacturing, distribution and charge
                control. During this assignment of precision agriculture farmers were given to be enrolled with via a
                Mobile App.
                The module will shop the info of the farmers, periodic soil houses of lands, insecticides required for
                the
                real crops, quantity of pesticide vital. Big information evaluation at the statistics is great crop
                sequences
                evaluation, general manufacturing requirement of pesticide and consequently the herbicide for the crop.
                Part of the version is used for the quantity of pesticide spraying that is vital for the unique crop may
                be
                finished this procedure is automation with the assist of a microcontroller and the information is
                obtained from all of the sensors and the motor and the pump and receives computerized with the time
                restriction
                set through the user. After the procedure is finished the farmer may be notified. Precision farming is
                been utilized in agriculture from previous couple of years. It is a way to form the procedure of farming
                more precise and accurate. The key components used for precision farming are automated hardwareâ€™s,
                wireless sensors, robotics, etc. There is different type of agricultural drones which is used to improve
                the productivity of crops.<br><br>
                <b class="card-title"><u>Conclusion:</u></b><br>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis project is a multidisciplinary approach for smart agriculture using key
                technolo-gies: Internet of Things, Sensors, Mobile Computing and Big-Data Analysis. Through real-time
                sampling of soil, the farmer
                will be able to get current fertilizer requirements for the crop. This is an essen-tial requirement
                towards the agriculture sector in India to get improved crop pro-duction with a reduction in the cost of
                pesticide requirements keeping the crop intact and away from the pests which affect the crop. As the
                data
                is collected for crop details and soil conditions, this model provides Big-Data analysis for best crop
                sequence, next crop to be cultivated for better production, pesticide requirements are analyzed. As all
                the agriculture-related entities are connect-ed, this will also facilitate the farmer and reduce its
                job. This model also facilitates the estimates of the total production of crop re-gion wise and state
                wise, pesticide require-ments. This will be helpful to stay the value of agricultural products on top of
                things . Through notifications, farmers will also be informed about current schemes for agricul-ture,
                weather conditions, and next crop to be produced, access to mix the solution and spray on the crop when
                it is necessary.
